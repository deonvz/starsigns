The slow Capricorn may prove to be too much for the carefree nature of Leo. Leo 
forgives and forgets; Capricorn being the one who is slow to anger and seldom 
forgets. This pair would not form the ideal basis for mutual understanding. This 
is especially true on matters of sex. The Capricorn has the tendency to be of 
suspicious motives, while Leo will wholeheartedly enter the arena with no 
thought of consequences . The "hail fellow well met" attitude of Leo's nature 
will prove to be too much for Capricorn to cope with through the long haul.
These two are almost complete opposites, the conservative capricorn and the 
flambouyant leo. Leo likes to live for the moment and capricorn prefers to make 
calculated movements.
