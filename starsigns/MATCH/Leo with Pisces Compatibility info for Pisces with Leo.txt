The strong and hearty temperament of Leo may be too much for the subtle and 
sensitive Pisces. Pisces, with resilience, takes on the changing moods of any 
partnership. Impressionable Pisces is easily hurt by any trivial or imagined 
wrong, and becomes very difficult to cope with , and dangerous to boot. While 
Leo is flattered by the dependency of others, if he abused pisces, the 
resentment of pisces may be too much for Leo to take over a long period of time.
Firey leo and watery pisces. This is the depiction of these two. Generally not 
expected to work but both have an ability to learn from one another if they can 
get past their innate differences.
