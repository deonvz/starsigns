The sentimental combination of these two signs make for an ideal marriage. 
Although both will have their moments of gloom and doom, they will soon come out 
in the sunshine and forgive and forget. Lover's quarrels are frequent , but the 
making up is bliss . Both cherish home, possessions, and friends and there will 
be mutual effort to fulfill all obligations. 
Water and water, emotion and emotion, intuition and intuition. Sorry for being 
redundant but these two are so much alike in nature that you'd have some 
difficulty telling them apart. They are both romantic, need to love and be loved 
and can probably communicate to each other without speaking or making facial 
gestures. In fact they probably didn't even read this because they already knew 
they were meant to be together.
