Hit "back" on your browser to step back to the compatibility area you just left

 
Sagittarius being free and easy will find pisces too much of a heavy load to 
haul around. Though there is much here for an interesting and sincere 
relationship, Sagittarius may find that the marriage to pisces is too confining. 
Pity would soon be the order of the day instead of love, then there would be a 
struggle between conscience and duty. This combination should think very hard 
before saying "I do".
There will be a lot of confusion and wonder between these two. At times it will 
be good and at other times not good at all. Your natures are somewhat opposite 
to one another and the ability to understand the other's intent and actions will 
be evident.
