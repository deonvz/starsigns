Scorpio with Pisces
This may be a love at first sight combination, however it seldom lasts a long 
period of time. Everything seems fine until Pisces gets tired of the little 
interests that seem to keep Scorpio occupied outside of the home. Positive 
qualities of pisces are not appreciated by scorpio,who feel that possessiveness 
is his own sacred domain. The latching on of pisces has scorpio's sympathies, 
but respect is soon lost for the weaker member, and the relationship will soon 
deteriorate.
But, on the positive side there is an intuitive bond here that both will find 
ageeable. There is attraction and emotion and feelings and all that good stuff 
that you both like. Not too much though. Just be sure you can still see clearly 
and realistically once in awhile
