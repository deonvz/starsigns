      Compatibility For Aries with Pisces

Having a sentimental nature the Pisces finds little comfort in the aggressive 
Arien. Pisceans are romantic and they desire the delicate approach that the 
Arien lacks. Neptune, the planet of the higher mind , gives pisces an ethereal 
quality. Unless the Arien mate is wiling to take a trip to the clouds now and 
then, the partnership will prove incompatible. 
Pisces will inadvertantly put out the fire of aries. There is not much that is 
compatible about these two,unless one can appreciate the diversity of human 
beings.
