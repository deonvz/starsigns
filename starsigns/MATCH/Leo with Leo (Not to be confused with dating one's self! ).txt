      Compatibility For Leo with Leo

This should prove to be a compatible combination, but it is not always true. 
Leo's are positive people and love to be the center of attraction. They want to 
be the head of their social groups. The two are constantly competing for 
leadership, unhappy results can result from this. The only hope for a successful 
partnership is for the female to be content to rule the home and the male to 
shine in the business and social world. 
Two positive and strong willed individuals. Two kings in the same country. This 
country isn't big enough for the both of you and you both know it. Trouble is, 
you both are so much in love with love that you may ignore the reality.
