Scorpio with Sagittarius
Scorpio is dominant by nature, but Scorpio will have trouble keeping their 
Sagittarian partner under control. This freedom loving sign will surly bring out 
the worst in Scorpios nature. Mutual distrust is easy here. The Scorpion 
possessiveness will make life unbearable for Sagittarius. It is true that from 
the sexual standpoint, Scorpio is attractive to the Sagittarian lust, but thats 
where the compatibility ends. Not a recommended combination.
Live and learn is about the best thing to expect here. Both can bring out some 
of the other's better qualities but the chance of anything long lasting is 
remote.
