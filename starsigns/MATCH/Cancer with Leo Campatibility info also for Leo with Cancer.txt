Usually this is a good combination, since the Moon (Cancer) reflects the light 
of the Sun (Leo). There is a lot to be said for these two, especially if Cancer 
will be happy reflecting the admirable Leonian personality. Leo's huge heart 
will soon forgive the moody outbursts that Cancer shows from time to time and 
which result from the strong influence of the Moon, Cancer's ruling planet. 
Cancer more than any other sign, responds to the moon's aspects as it moves 
swiftly through the zodiac.
Cancer will feel a bit more enthused around Leo and will probably let Leo run 
things or at least let them think they are in charge and hey! what's the 
difference. Leo will appreciate cancer's attention and as long as cancer can 
forget that they feel neglected at times when leo is out running the world, 
there is a chance this could work.
