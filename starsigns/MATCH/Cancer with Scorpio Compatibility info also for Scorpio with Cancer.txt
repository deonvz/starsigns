Masterful Scorpio should make a good mate for quiet spoken cancer. While 
jealousy may plague both from time to time, their great mutual ability to love 
deeply will usually limit periods of dissension. Scorpio is well equipped to 
cope with cancerian moods. Excess energy which Scorpio emanates, will act as 
strong tonic for cancer's reticence. Scorpio and cancer could well prove the 
ideal marriage combination.

constructive or very distructive depending on the next wave. If water signs 
could only learn to float instead of surge.
