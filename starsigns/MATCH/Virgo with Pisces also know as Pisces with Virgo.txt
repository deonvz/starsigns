Pisces is the very opposite of virgo. In the zodiac they are 180 degrees apart. 
Opposites often find compatibility, even though astrologicly speaking they are 
opposing signs. This may be that contrast makes for interest, and in virgo and 
Pisces the contrast is very marked. It will take a great deal of patience and 
understanding on the part of virgo to cope with the moody, sentimental nature of 
pisces over a long period of time. If the virgo mate will show a bit more 
sentimental emotions it will go a long way in making this combination happy.; 
however a little sentimentality is a dangerous thing. 
This is another pair of zodiac opposites that can be great at times and terrible 
at others times. Zodiac opposites can learn a lot about themselves from their 
counterparts.
