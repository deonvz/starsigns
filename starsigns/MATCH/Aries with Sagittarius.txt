This first and third sign combination of the fiery Trinity usually makes an 
ideal partnership. In fact, my own Mother and Father are this combination. They 
stayed together for 19 years. Upon close examination of their synastry, there 
are aspects that make the long haul difficult. Most people of these matches are 
in it for life. 
The Mars-Jupiter duo are usually an ideal match for each other. Both are 
creatures of impulse. Both can have outside interest without conflict or 
friction from the other. The Sagittarius banner is "liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness"; Aries is usually willing to subscribe to this theory. And for that 
reason, this makes them a good match.
