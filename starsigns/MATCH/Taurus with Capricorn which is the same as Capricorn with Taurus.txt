Taurus with Capricorn
With both partners having mutual understanding of each other's personalities 
this can be a very compatible marriage. Venus and Saturn blend very well from a 
emotional point of view. Both need a certain amount of flattery and 
encouragement, but Taurus will be the one who must take the lead in this 
direction. While Capricorn may seem a bit cold and aloof at first, the warm rays 
of Venus will soon melt the exterior of caution and prudence that is inherent in 
all Capricorns.
A good combination of the basic earth signs. Both are responsible and practical 
natures. They even have a mutual desire for success and material things. There 
is a need to infuse some light-hearted fun when things become too serious, even 
some conservative fun would be enough.
