Virgo with Scorpio
The combination sometimes belongs to the mutual admiration society. The virgo 
mind is very fascinated with the mysterious and intriguing Scorpio. Out of all 
the signs Scorpio is the most likely one to curb virgo's tendency to sulk. Virgo 
respects scorpio's ability to analyze all situations and thereby sidesteps 
controversial issues before they they become grounds for an argument. If virgo 
will keep from hurting scorpio's pride, this combination will be happy and 
enduring.
The only problem here is on the emotional side. Scorpio thrives on it and virgo 
subdues it. Aside from that a friendship or business arrangement may be the best 
idea.
