This combination sometimes have a great deal of bickering because of strong 
differences about sex. Gemini being a mercurial sign, where the mind plays an 
important part in all love making, and the emotional Martian Arien may be too 
much for the conventional nature of the Gemini. 
All in all , Gemini respects the refined, intellectual approach to continual 
bliss. Impatient Ariens may find this frustrating, after awhile may try to find 
a less difficult companion. 
Not a great match up, but can work with understanding and effort. As with any 
relationship, love truly does conquer all. Gemini, after all, may end up being 
the "reality check" Aries needs to calm down. Don't get me wrong, Aries is not a 
monster, they in fact, have many fantastic qualities! It is just that the Arien 
energy level is so high, that it may prove too much for Gemini.
