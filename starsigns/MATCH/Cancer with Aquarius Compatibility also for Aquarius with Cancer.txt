      Compatibility For Cancer with Aquarius

The social side of the Aquarian may prove to be too much for the home bodied 
Cancer. Aquarian's love to share their life stories with the world while cancer 
is satisfied to concentrate on personal obligations. Cancer have a conservative 
taste; Aquarius taste are usually the opposite. The eccentricity of Uranus does 
not go well with the moods of Luna. Odds against this combination are too great 
for this combination, unless one will become subservient to the other.
Aquarius has a need to be independant and often appears detached in a close 
relationship and will appear more so to cancer. Don't get me wrong, aquarians 
need to loved too, they just exhibit more of a universal love than personal and 
when push comes to shove they'll take the world anytime.( of course which world 
that is , no-one knows for sure.)
