Taurus with Gemini
The Gemini personality may prove to be to restless for the Taurean nature. The 
two signs are emotionally at odds. the mercurian outlook on intimate matters 
does not sit well with the son or daughter of Venus. the Gemini loves a variety 
of thought, and delights in all mental pursuits, while the Taurean is mostly 
interested in the material things of life. The great sex drive of the Taurean 
could overpower the more docile Gemini. 
Taurus with the innate need to possess will never be able to hang on to the 
unsettled gemini.Gemini loves change and taurus resists it so don't bet you 
money on this one.
