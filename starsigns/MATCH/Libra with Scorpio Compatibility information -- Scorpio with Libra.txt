There is much sympathetic magnetism between these two signs. While Scorpio is 
the more dominant sign of the two, the libran's beauty and sense of fair play 
appeal to Scorpios good judgment. Libra sees all the virtues that she admires in 
Scorpio, for scorpio's sex drive is all libra's hope to be. There is much to 
recommend this union, for they have many sympathies in common. Librans are 
sentimental and susceptible as lovers. This seems to be appealing to scorpio's 
dominant and possessive urges. AS long as libra does not hurt scorpio's pride, 
Librians will find what they are looking for when they marry a Scorpio.
There is a strong sexual attraction here, but libra may find scorpio's intense 
nature a bit overwhelming. Common goals and shared interests could avert any 
difficulties.
