Aries with Aquarius
The unpredictable Aquarian may tax an Arien mate's patience while the 
instability of the Arien temperament will surely provoke the sign of good will 
and self-sacrifice. Such are the bones of contention that made this partnership 
a gamble. The planet Uranus, which rules Aquarius, is unpredictable in its 
actions; therefore, Aquarians have a tendency to procrastinate too much to 
please the Arien "up and at ' em" characteristics. 
This could possibly be a good relationship, but will require a constructive 
attitude on both parts. Both signs are independant natures but at times 
aquarius' will do things without notice with which aries may become impatient.
