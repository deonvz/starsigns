      Compatibility For Cancer with Capricorn

Cancer and Capricorn are 180 degrees in opposition from each other 
astrologically speaking, but it need not be true in life. Both signs have plenty 
in common. The cancer's great sympathy and understanding is honey to the 
capricorn's misunderstood complaints. Both have a tendency to plod along until 
they get what they want. Capricorn has the ability to make cancer's dream come 
true, while cancer is happy wishing for and wanting the success and security 
that the Capricorn mate strives for.
The elements of water and earth go well together but these are zodiac opposites 
you can expect both side of the coin. You'll have to take the good with the bad 
and there will be plenty of both. Capricorn lacks the warmth and sentiment that 
cancer requires.
