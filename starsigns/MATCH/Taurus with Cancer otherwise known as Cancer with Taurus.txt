Taurus with Cancer
Usually this makes a good combination. Cancer likes a good home with much 
affection. This is what every Taurean hopes to find when undertaking 
conventional responsibilities. From an emotional point of view, there is nothing 
in the stars that bars the prospect of a happy married life between these two 
partners. One thing the Taurean must remember is that Cancer is exceedingly 
sensitive, and will crawl into a shell if unhappy emotionally. 
This is a good combination as both signs are naturally attracted by the others 
sense for feelings and emotions. Taurus will appreciate cancer's inherent caring 
attitude and cancer will appreciate taurus' homey nature.
