Taurus with Libra
These are both ruled by Venus, the love goddess and it does shine on the two 
love birds, that is until one steps out of line. Then the feathers will fly. 
However there are common interest and a meeting of the mind and body making this 
a very good marital combination.
These two signs are intrinsically joined by their ruling planet Venus. They 
appreciate beauty and the finer things of life. A large bank account will be 
needed for these two to appease their desire for luxury. The success of this 
relationship will require libra's sense of diplomacy and taurus's patience. 
Libra an air sign, loves to roam and taurus an earth sign loves to sit and smell 
the roses. With understanding it could be a harmonic relationship.
