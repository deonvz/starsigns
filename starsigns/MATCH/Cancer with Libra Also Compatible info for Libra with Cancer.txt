Cancer is not temperamentally suited to cope with the freedom loving Libran. 
They could go for days of no recognition if they have a serious disagreement. 
Libra's great desire for attention may bring on a period of sulking depression 
that could create a highly controversial situation. Though libra love's justice 
and fair play, cancer has a tendency to tale advantage of all of these quality 
for his own private use.
On the positive side though, they could make it. Ruled by the moon and venus 
respectively, there is common ground here despite the fact that we have a water 
sign and an air. The sensitive cancer can rest assured that libra is generally 
peace-loving and won't often stir things up. Libra is also love-loving as well 
and this should sit well with cancer. Libra will appreciate cancer's loyalty and 
generosity.
