Problems could be the word for the day should these two decide to get married, 
unless each one is willing to attempt a complete change of their star-predicted 
personalities. Cancer admires everything about the Sagittarian- here lies the 
problem, once the cancer has captured the busy footed, roving eyed Sagittarian , 
he or she will find it a "more than I bargained for proposition". Cancer is not 
going to keep the sagittarian partner close to the hearth. Cancer's home is his 
castle, but for the sagittarian home is just a place to hang his hat. Be careful 
with this combination.
A water and fire combination. There is a vast difference in natures here and the 
likelyhood of being compatible is all but impossible, unless there are 
mitigating aspects in other areas of their charts. Sagittarius is outgoing and 
forthright which will make cancer uneasy. Cancer is too needy for sagittarius. 
On the good side, they are both generous people.
