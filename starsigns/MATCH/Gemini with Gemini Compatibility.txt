A compatible combination this should prove to be, at least both would understand 
each other's changeable nature. The sex demands and needs would be mutual. The 
ONLY exception would be if Scorpio was on the rise at either time of birth. The 
demands of Scorpio would prove too much for the perky Mercurial Gemini nature, 
since Gemini's approach to sex is spiritual while too puritanical for the 
Gemini-Scorpio rising male. This combination has potential for excellent 
partnerships where the principals are engaged in corresponding vocations, such 
as singer-composer, author-publisher, etc.
The gemini penchant for change and variety will keep this relationship hopping. 
Whether it produces a happiness or sadness depends on at least one of them 
paying attention, at least some of the time. Discussions will be lively, life 
will be restless and ever changing but then again they wouldn't have it any 
other way.
