Virgo with Sagittarius
The Sagittarius love of freedom and change may prove too much for the meticulous 
virgo cosmopoliton. The Sagittarius male could easily fall in love with the 
virgo female. Her neat and clean ways intrigues him , but once he is married, he 
may soon find that he got more than he bargained for. He finds that the things 
that he liked most before he got married put him in a straight jacket after 
marriage. If its one thing a Sagittarius doe not like its bickering and a virgo 
will find plenty to bicker about.
The differences here are like day and night. Virgo with his/her eye on today and 
what needs to be done and sagittarius with their eye on tomorrow and what they'd 
like to be doing. Not all bad but difficult to reconcile.
