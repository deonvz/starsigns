Scorpio with Scorpio
Where is a combination that is confusing in its outcome. If both individuals 
have a thorough understanding of their inherent traits, they can have deep 
sympathy for each other. The dominant, possessive, and jealous temperaments of 
each are things which both will have to handle with extreme consideration. They 
both are intense in their love nature, and can get just what they are looking 
for in each other. If one suddenly gets inconsiderate of the other's tender 
spots, or does anything to upset the apple cart in the jealousy department, then 
the storm will began. This can be a very good combination or a very bad one.
This is about as intense a combination as you will ever find. It works well with 
common goals and objectives but when the fire is lit you best keep an eye on it 
because it may get out of control.
