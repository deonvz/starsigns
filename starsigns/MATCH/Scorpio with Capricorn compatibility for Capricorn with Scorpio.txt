Scorpio with Capricorn
This is a very hard combination to analyze. With scoripo's strong and powerful 
personality, Capricorn may clash, fighting for the last word when it comes to 
important decisions pertaining to family welfare. Capricorn can be mighty 
disagreeable when frustrated, and Scorpio will have to use the sting of the 
scorpian barb to move the Capricorn goat from a set course. The emotional 
incompatibility usually becomes unbearable for the combination to handle.
For practical matters there are common traits, but the stubborn nature of both 
signs could make them enemies when things get down and dirty.
