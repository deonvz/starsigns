Here are two signs with one goal - freedom of limb and action. They are usually 
a compatible combination with both being frank, outspoken, and a certain amount 
of personal freedom is cherished. Inconsistency is mutually agreeable to these 
two astrological affinities. 
They meet on a common ground, and can plan their lives with equanimity. 
Sometimes there will be times when the love nest will become ruffled and the 
feathers will fly, these lovebirds will fight more for the sake of diversion 
then for blood.
