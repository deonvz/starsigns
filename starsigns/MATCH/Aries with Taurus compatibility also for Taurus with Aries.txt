This fantastic match should make a winning combination. The Taurean nature is 
ruled by Venus, the goddess of love, this is what an Arien always seeks in a 
mate. Taurus appreciates Aries outward nature and Aries appreciates Taurus"s 
earthy nature; there would be far too many differences to expect it to last. 
What they appreciate about one another is also what they would dislike over 
time.Can be sexually dynamic but there's not much hope for anything more. 
Though the Taurus half of this relationship, being slow moving, may find the 
going a bit hectic , excitement may help to stimulate the friendship. Ariens 
should omit temperamental outbursts, for Taurus are not highly emotional on the 
surface, they can become obstinate and ferocious as a bull when it sees red. 
If ever a relationship was bound to make it in the long haul, this is it. Should 
a breakup occur with these two, the Taurean may come surprisingly to life, 
giving fiery Aries a run for their money! This is not likely with these two 
however, as most matches of these are likened to "a match made in Heaven". 
Though Aries is an impatient, energetic sign, rather domineering , Taurus should 
not have any difficulty finding compatibility with this sign. The slower-moving 
Taurus may find the going a bit hectic, but the excitement nay help stimulate 
courtship since Taurus is a highly emotional sign, though very obstinate when 
dictated to. The Taurean, ruled by Venus, goddess of love will usually show the 
Mars-ruled Aries the error of his ways when they meet on a common level.
