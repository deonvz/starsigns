Taurus with Taurus
From a purely physical stand point , this appears to be a compatible 
combination. Due to tendencies of jealousy and stubbornness there could be 
trouble on the mental plane. One or the other must be willing to give way when 
the tempers flare and accusations fly, or serious difficulties could arise to 
mar the nuptial bliss. one point in favor is that both understand the little 
quirks of the other, and if deeply in love, they will readily forge.
This can be a very stable relationship, in fact so stable that it could become 
stale. However this stability is central to taurus' needs and if you can do 
without adventure and change then this is your ticket.
