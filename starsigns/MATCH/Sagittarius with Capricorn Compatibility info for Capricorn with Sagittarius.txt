Unless Sagittarius can clip their wings a bit, there is strong warning against 
this combination. Their temperament are entirely different, one is optimistic, 
the other is pessimistic. The devil-may-care attitude of Sagittarius may prove 
to be too much for the somber and restrictive temperament of Capricorn. This 
would surely make the sagittarian unhappy, as he or she would have the type of 
love that "passes all understanding" to find any happiness at all with this 
combination.
Here again we see the difference between the austere, conservative capricorn and 
the outgoing, risk taking sagittarius. Not much in the way of compatibility but 
as with most combinations they can learn from each other.
