Not a hopeful combination. Saturn, represented by Father Time, is the Capricorn 
standard bearer. Thus, Capricorns are ussually very patient. Capricorn are 
traditionally laid back and easy going. Ariens are too impatient to cope with 
the slow, methodical plodding of the Capricorn nature. The Capricorn goat will 
butt up against the Martian will and an impasse is bound to occur. In the matter 
of sex there is an affinity; however, their inherent personalities clash. 
Here we see the combination of a fire sign with an earth sign. Aries is a fiery 
in nature while capricorn is more down to earth, cautious and reserved. Aries 
prefers to take action while capricorn would rather plan and wait. Without a 
great deal of tolerence, there is not much hope for this union.
