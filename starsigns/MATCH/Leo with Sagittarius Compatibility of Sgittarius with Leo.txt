This makes an excellent combination most of the time. It is said that fire must 
be fought with fire, and it seems to fit for the marriage of these two signs, 
with little exceptions. Both love change and excitement and have a great zest 
for life. Both are domineering, that's where the danger lies; this could lead to 
trouble if the Leo tried to relegate the sagittarian to the sidelines. 
Sagittairans with their independent nature would rebel, this could lead to a 
serious rift in the partnership.
This is an excellent combination for the most part unless sagittarius is in need 
of to much freedom and leo becomes too bossy.
