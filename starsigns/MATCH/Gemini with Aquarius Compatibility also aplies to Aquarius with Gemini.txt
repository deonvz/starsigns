The caring, humanitarian thoughts of Aquarius will find a willing home with 
Gemini. Uranus, the ruling planet of Aquarius, is full of surprises and sudden 
changes. This will suit the Gemini perfectly. There will be plenty of none stop 
variety to afford the stimulation that Gemini needs for its dual personality. 
Geminis are always looking for surprises and the Aquarian can readily supply 
them. A warning bell here though, .. When the Aquarian mate wants to be alone, 
Gemini should not be offended. This is only a passing condition and will soon 
disappear. At times the Aquarian most have time alone. (no offense Gemini!)
