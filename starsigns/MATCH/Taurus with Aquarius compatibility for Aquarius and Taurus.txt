Taurus with Aquarius
This combination heads in for many difficulties. The Aquarian being 
unpredictable may prove to much for the easy going Taurus nature., The 
conservative habits of the Taurean will soon get on the nerves of the dynamic 
Aquarius and the tempers will start to fly. Both love ease and comfort but their 
views on how to obtain them are very different. Another big irritation for the 
Taurus lover is the unwillingness of the Aquarius to share his secrets.
These two live on opposite sides of the planet, in fact some times, Taurus will 
wonder if Aquarius is even from this planet. The usually staid taurus will have 
difficulty understanding the aquarian unpredictability. Aquarius will find the 
taurus attention somewhat smothering and restrictive.
