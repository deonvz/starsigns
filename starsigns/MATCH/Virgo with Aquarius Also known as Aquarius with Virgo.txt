Aquarius with Virgo
Aquarius may hold too many surprises for the conservative virgo to cope with. 
This is an elaborate combination to analyze. Alot depends on the cultural and 
educational levels of the partners. If there is a marked difference between the 
two, the chances for a happy and enduring marriage are almost nill. But if both 
happen to be collage sweethearts or if they do the same sort of work, chances 
for a happy marriage are greatly increased. There is no happy medium with this 
combination, it is either very good or very bad.
There can be an intellectual togetherness here but that is about where it ends. 
Almost everything else about the relationship will be puzzling especially to 
virgo. Don't expect any deep emotional scenes.
