Here is a good chance for a happy partnership. Magnanimous Leo will overlook 
Virgo's tendency to be critical, while virgo will take pride in Leo's 
accomplishments, good humor, and lovable nature. Leo will respect virgo's clever 
and alert mentality. If virgo will permit Leo to hog the limelight and refrain 
from being too critical of Leo's star predicted desire to hold the central place 
in the family circle, they should have no real barriers to a happy and 
successful partnership. This may be hard.
This is one of those relationships that depends on the type of relationship it 
is. If it's love the dominant leo will overwhelm virgo, whose criticism will erk 
leo. In business it is best when leo leads and virgo follows and the differences 
will be tolerated.
