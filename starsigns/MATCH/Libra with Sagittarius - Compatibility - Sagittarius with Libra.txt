Sagittarius 's philosophy of life may be to much for the free and easy going 
libra to cope with. However , this is a good marital combination. Libra will get 
all the excitement they want if they marry Sagittarius. The only question will 
be is will libra's endurance be able to last through the long haul with the 
Sagittarius partner? The libran love of beauty, luxury, and social whirl appeals 
to the Sagittarius,. but he will not be tied to the libran apron-string. 
Sagittarius hates bondage and can not be confined, and will not tolerate 
bondage, whether it be legal or not, and will use all the means at his command 
to break through bonds.
Again we have the tactful libra nature surfacing to create some harmony in the 
relationship.They will do well together, if sagittarius can manage to be around 
enough to fulfill libra's need for togetherness.
