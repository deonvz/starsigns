      Compatibility For Gemini with Leo

While Leo loves with his heart first, Gemini loves with his mind. This 
combination will soon find out that they are unsuited for each other. On the 
surface there is great mutual attraction for both signs. Both are naturally 
attracted to glamor, flattery and the world of good fellowship, both will have 
this in common. BUT after they return home from the party, the carefree , 
passionate Leo will surely clash with the unreasonable Gemini. Of course the 
Gemini will complain that the Leo love of nature is too material , possessive 
and demanding.
There is good reason to be optomistic about this pairing though, dispite the 
above, that is if Leo can understand that gemini won't always be around to give 
them the attention they thrive on. Gemini will need to understand Leo's need to 
run the world, but all in all this is a very good combination of air and fire.
