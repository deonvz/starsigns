Scorpio with Aquarius
This combination usually ends up getting into unpleasant terms after a little 
time. Unpredictable Aquarius is too much for the solid Scorpio temperament. 
Aquarius has many of outside interests and this does not sit well with Scorpio. 
Aquarius are too reserved for the passionate Scorpio. Humanitarian instincts is 
what Scorpio admires in an aquarian, but Scorpio has no interest in sharing them 
with the world.
Scorpio wants to possess the person and aquarius want to own the world. Without 
some extremely mature attitude adjustment it will be difficult to rectify the 
inherent differences in each other's nature.
