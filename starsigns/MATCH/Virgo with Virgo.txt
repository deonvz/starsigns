Virgo with Virgo
Finding anything resembling compatibility would be hard for this combination. 
Both have a tendency to end up with a battle of the wits with both opponents 
evenly matched. Each would over exaggerate the faults of the other. At best it 
would be a commonplace marriage, with the possibility of husband and wife 
talking each other to distraction.
However... My mate is a Virgo and so am I! We get along great, and we are going 
on 5 years together so far. I think what makes us work is the fact that we 
specialize in different areas. I am into computers (gee.. that was hard to guess 
;), where as Beth is great at accounting, into landscaping and remodeling. If 
two Virgos have two different specialties this is the key. I personally think 
Virgos get along great under these circumstances. (uhmm... Honey can I come to 
bed now?...)
