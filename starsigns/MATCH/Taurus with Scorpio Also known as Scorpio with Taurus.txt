Taurus with Scorpio
This combination mutually admires each other. With a strong sexual urge both 
will find much in common. Jealousy however is the big problem with this pair and 
seems to be always showing its face. Taurus must be careful to keep faith with 
the scorpion mate, or the house will fall down without warning. Beware to the 
one who crosses the scorpion's path, the sting is considered deadly.
These are zodiac opposites, but they are compatible earth and water signs.This 
usually manifests itself in a strong physical attraction at first. Both signs 
are intensely passionate, more so with Scorpio and both are the jealous and 
possessive types.
