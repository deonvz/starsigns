With these two signs having the same virtues and vices they should get along 
well together, at least they will have understanding and sympathy for one 
another. Both have the same interests and the same love of home and possessions. 
The only possible drawback is a drifting too far from practical realities. At 
least both can be anchored to each other, so that they can put their shoulders 
to the wheel and face the responsibilities that reality demands. They have the 
refinement and delicacy that each desires in love, so all in all, this should be 
a good combination.
A double dose of intuition, dreams, emotion and fantasy. So where is the logic?. 
Who needs it? Could be too much alike to avoid confusion and disarray in the 
relationship.Maybe you could get an advisor to handle those nagging day to day 
matters that so often slip your minds.
