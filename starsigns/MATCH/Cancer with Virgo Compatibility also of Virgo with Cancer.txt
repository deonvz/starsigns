Virgo's demands may be a bit much for Cancer's desire for peace and quiet. The 
full, affectionate libido of cancer will not be completely satisfied by virgo's 
direct approach to the practical matters at hand. Cancer is sentimental , 
reticent, and even shy about sex matters, and this can be very frustrating to 
the virgo temperament. Once cancer goes into his shell, all the tongue lashing 
and nagging of virgo will not bring him out. This could drive the virgo mate 
into a state of hysteria.
However, there are good possiblitiies, with a few common aspects thrown in. 
Cancer will appreciate virgo's care and attention to detail, although they may 
not appreciate the critical eye of virgo, especially when that criticism is 
aimed at cancer who takes things to heart as a rule. Virgo will appreciate the 
loyalty and sincerity of cancer, but will need to be a little more demonstrative 
and affectionate with cancer.
