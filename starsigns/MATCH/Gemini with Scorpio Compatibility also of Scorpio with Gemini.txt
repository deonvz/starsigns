      Compatibility For Gemini with Scorpio

Here Gemini has found a mate that can surpass the Gemini urge for action. Gemini 
is more than a match from a mental standpoint, but from a sexual and physical 
viewpoint, Gemini is too modest to meet Scorpio's demands. Gemini's desire for 
freedom of action will clash with the jealous and possessive nature of Scorpio. 
While some Gemini-Scorpio combinations may work out fairly well, the pure 
Gemini- Scorpio alliance packs as much power as an atomic bomb.
An air sign with a water sign. These two will have some difficulty rectifying 
their innate natures. Love conquers all. Then again, too much, stifles some.
