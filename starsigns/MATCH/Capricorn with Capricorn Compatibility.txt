      Compatibility For Capricorn with Capricorn



Hit "back" on your browser to step back to the compatibility area you just left

 
There is much compatibility between these two signs which should make for an 
enduring marriage. Both have the same long range aspirations and the basic 
qualities to attain them. They both have the same faults, which may keep fault 
finding down to a minimum. With important issues, they would both have what it 
takes to over come any hardship. Great mixture for a happy relationship.
The biggest problem here will be keeping things lively and new. You are of 
course both alike in your values and many of your actions. Things could become 
too serious for too long and stubborness could cause some alienation. If you can 
get past these things and communicate once in awhile you may enjoy the things 
that make you like personalities.
