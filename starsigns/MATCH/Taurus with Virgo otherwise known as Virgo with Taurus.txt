Taurus with Virgo
Taurus should avoid the attrwedeness of the Virgoan if a love at first sight is 
to be avoided. Taurus will not get his way here. The Taurean does not like to be 
critiqued , the sharpest weapon of the Virgo. If you don't like allot of nagging 
, don't take a Virgo mate. 
With both being earth signs there will be much common ground for these two. Both 
virgo and taurus desire material success and security. The one drawback is that 
virgo is normally in control of their emotional output while taurus thrives on 
deep emotion and could perhaps overwhelm virgo.
