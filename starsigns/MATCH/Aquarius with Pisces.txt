Aquarius with Pisces
If pisces will study the Aquarian horoscope , this may not be a bad combination. 
Here are tolerance and human sympathy coupled with the need for human 
understanding by the pisces partner, who is willing to go all out to find that 
the elusive cup of human tolerance and dignity. He will be sure to find this in 
his aquarian mate. If the pisces will give the Aquarius the benefit of the 
doubt, the marriage will be a happy and lasting one.
This can be a very unconventional relationship. Both opperate on a different 
wavelength than the other signs of the zodiac. Dreams are somehow reality for 
both these people and that's not to say that they are unaware of reality. It's 
just that neither carries their own anchor to bring them back down to earth, so 
unless someone helps to ground them occasionaly we may never be sure exactly 
where they are.
