Virgo with Libra
Another combination that would have trouble finding marital bliss. There is one 
thing that Libra can not take and that is criticism, and of course virgo is a 
champion in that department. Virgo is very particular to detail, while Libra is 
easygoing and detest detail. The conflict of interest will cause a storm soon 
after the sexual novelty has worn off.
There is hope though, Libra looks for peace and harmony is likely to do well 
with virgo who is a perfectionist in his/her own right. Providing the aspects in 
the synastry are just right. (we do custom synastry's by the way) ;)
