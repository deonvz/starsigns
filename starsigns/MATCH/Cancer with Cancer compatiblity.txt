This combination can make a beautiful love out of their married life, because 
each will have a sympathetic understanding for the other's moods, wishes 
desires, and needs. Though there are times were they can totally disagree, with 
each clinging to the experience and teaching of early childhood, each will 
understand the other. Both will have the tenacity of glue on paper, once its 
there it will be there regardless of peril. Each will give sympathetic 
consideration to this trait in the other, and they should have no trouble in 
finding constant bliss.
First thing you need to do is get a manual that tells you who goes first and on 
what night. Otherwise you are both going to just sit there and wonder. How "did" 
you two manage to get together anyway? Whose initiative was it and will he or 
she call again? A movie that needs a director! And by the way, try to avoid 
those emotional scenes, unless you really are acting.
