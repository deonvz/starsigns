Here there is mutual attraction, but it seldom lasts long. This is especially 
true under intimate circumstances. Pisces will be content with Libra's exclusive 
company, But libra's love of social affairs may generate jealousy and disharmony 
in the intimate life. Libra can get along will with mast people, but the pisces 
is more discriminating, and this is the source of their disagreements. Nothing 
makes libra more miserable then a sulky, complaining pisces.
Their is a mutual appreciation for art and beauty and all that it entails 
between these two. A reasonably good combination.
