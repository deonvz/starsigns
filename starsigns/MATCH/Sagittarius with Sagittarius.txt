If this combination is not on the same intellectual and social plane, there is 
little hope for this couple to have a long happy relationship. They will have to 
do everything together or nothing at all. All interests being social and 
business must be the same. Both are freedom lovers but even this must be enjoyed 
together, as neither male nor female is willing to sit at home while the other 
has a night on the town. Look before you leap will be good advise if this couple 
is to get together.
Two lively, optomistic people on the go all the time. This could work if some 
attention is given to the relationship. It could also suffer from lack of 
attention since both will be off somewhere doing something other than 
maintaining togetherness. May work better as friends or partners.
