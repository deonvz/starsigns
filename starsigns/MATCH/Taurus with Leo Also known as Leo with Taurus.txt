Taurus with Leo
Venus and the Sun make a good combination, especially when each understands the 
other's faults. Excellent physical qualities and great sex appeal are there for 
both partners. Magnanimous Leo is just what the doctor ordered for the Taurean's 
love of the finer things in life. As long as the Taurus restrains jealousy and 
lets the Leo show off a bit all will go well with this combination.
Taurus will supply the attention that leo requires but will expect it to be 
returned. Leo loves to dominate and eventually taurus being strong willed but 
more patient, will raise the sword when their needs are not being met. A strong 
attraction physically and emotionally but perhaps too many obstacles to hurdle.
