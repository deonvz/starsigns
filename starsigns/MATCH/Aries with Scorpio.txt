Since there is no room for two heads in one family, this combination is not an 
ideal match. With Mars dominating both signs it makes for very positive 
temperaments unless their are several benign natal planetary aspects. In simple 
terms, there are conditions which when meet in their natal chart, (a synastry 
will determine this) they may actually be a good match. This is rare however, 
because both are natural born leaders and we all know, only one can lead. 
While Scorpio may adore the Aries from a sexual standpoint , their more mundane 
interests would be constantly at odds. Scorpio may also be intimidated by Aries 
leadership tendencies, and this may lead to some resentments.
