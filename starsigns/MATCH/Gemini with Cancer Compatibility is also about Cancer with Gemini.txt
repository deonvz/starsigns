The home body cancer may find club loving Gemini too hard to get for a good 
mate. While Gemini is constantly on the alert for change, Cancer is satisfied to 
become a truly domesticated mate. On the other hand , the cancerean moodiness 
may become too much for Gemini to cope with. There would be better compatibility 
where the female is a Gemini and the male is a Cancer, especially if there are 
several children to keep the Gemini mother's time occupied.
Cancers are driven by emotion and feelings and generally prefer the constant. 
Gemini's unstoppable movement will prove unsettling to Cancer.
