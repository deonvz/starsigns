A great combination of Mars and Venus. The warm and passionate Libran will make 
a welcome home for the fiery, impetuous Aries. This will be particularly true if 
both persons are on the same cultural and intellectual plane. This could be a 
poor match if either one of them is from a culture or religion varying from 
their own. 
Aries appreciates the passion and emotion that Librians possess. However too 
much of a good thing could spoil it. There must be balance for this to work. 
There is a wider the ordinary margin for error though, and most of these 
combinations will go the distance. Libra's refined and artistic temperament 
yearns for reciprocal attachments. And this is something Aries can provide.
