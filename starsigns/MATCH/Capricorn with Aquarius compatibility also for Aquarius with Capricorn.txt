      Compatibility For Capricorn with Aquarius

This is a very hard combination to analyze. The sure footed Capricorn may prove 
to be too much for the nimble water bearer Aquarius, who aims to make the world 
a better place to live in. Capricorn wants all effort and anything else Aquarius 
has to give- to be centered at home for their mutual good. Capricorn does not 
like the interest that Aquarius shows to other people. Aquarius doe not like 
confinement or restriction at all, and may fly the coop to go out into the world 
to find something more suitable. A very doubtful combination.
There is a huge difference in values and personality here. The organized 
capricorn and the never organized aquarius. Too many other differences as well 
and unless you have other compatible aspects in your birthcharts, don't expect a 
long lasting affair.
