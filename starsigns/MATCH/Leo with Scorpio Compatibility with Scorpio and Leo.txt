      Compatibility For Leo with Scorpio



Hit "back" on your browser to step back to the compatibility area you just left

 
Two shinning personalities join together. They have alot in common, especially 
when Leo is the female and Scorpio is the male. The Scorpio female is too 
demanding for the Leo male. Jealousy plays a major role in family quarrels. 
Basically , this should make for one of the most compatible combinations , but 
long and happy partnership will be far better when a Leo female marries a 
Scorpio male.
Two very strong willed individuals generally create some rather stormy moments . 
Without some mutual give and take there is rocky road ahead.
