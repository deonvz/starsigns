Taurus with Pisces
This usually is a very happy combination. Sentimental Pisces will find great 
comfort in sympathetic Taurus. Neptune who is the ruler of Pisces, is the higher 
octave of Venus, who in turn, rules Taurus. Pisces being romantic, imaginative, 
impressionable and flexible, is just what the Taurus native is looking for.
These two can share a great deal of their appreciation for beauty, art, 
sensuality and just about any of the finer things in life. Pisces is easily 
clouded by emotion but can be brought to reality by taurus' down to earth 
nature. Taurus can be helped to dream by the piscean personality. Lots of good 
stuff, but watch the emotions.
