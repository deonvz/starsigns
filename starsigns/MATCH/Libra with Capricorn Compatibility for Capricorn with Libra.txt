On the surface these two seem to be on the opposite, but the taciturn Capricorn 
is very much intrigued by libra. If libra does not find the steady Capricorn 
nature too boring, there is good chance here for a successful marriage. The 
Capricorn before he marries is far more liberal on his view s on sex before 
marriage then he will be afterward. Libra had better screen the social 
environment to suit capricorn's views or there may be some embarrassing moments 
later on.
Unless capricorn can open up a little more there could be problems here. Libra 
requires affection and capricorn tends to put it off.
