Here is a match made in heaven, unless one had an incompatible sign rising at 
birth. They both have basically the same interests and qualities, so there would 
be great understanding in the relationship.While both like to be admired, and 
may cast a roving eye away from home territory, each is understanding of the 
other's motives . With this combination there is so much in common and so little 
negatives against it (a possible incompatible sign rising in either birth chart) 
there is no hesitation in advising it.
The biggest problem may be unresolved conflicts, as neither wants to stir the 
pot when differences appear. They may both say the heck with it and thats all, 
just to preserve the peace. But if this is the worst that could happen, well...
