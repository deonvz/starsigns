This is usually a great combination, with both sides being emotional in their 
make up, Leo will lionize an Arien mate. This is particularly true if Aries will 
allow Leo to hold the center of the floor on occasions. Sharing the limelight is 
important on Leo's part however, as Aries will feel the need to be on stage once 
in a while as well. 
In the lion's den the impetuous Aries lover will find a welcome home. Their sex 
life could be legendary and infidelity kept to a minimum, or eliminated all 
together. This is because they will probably find what they want from each 
other, and not have a physical compulsion to stray. Leo admires the aggressive 
tendencies of fiery contemporaries. This is exactly what Ariens are, making this 
an ideal union.
