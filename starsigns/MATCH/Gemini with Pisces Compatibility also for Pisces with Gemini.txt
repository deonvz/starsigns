The freedom of those Geminis out there are at stake if you marry a Pisean. They 
must be prepared to give up all outside interests and devote all of thier time 
and thoughts to the Pisces mate. The sensitive and distrustful Piscean nature 
will, no doubt, prove too much for the liberty loving Gemini to cope with.
Geminians must be prepared to change their ways almost completely if they would 
seek happiness with a loving, possessive, and clinging Pisces.
Both of these people are usually "live and let live" types, but it's a stretch 
here. Gemini, always on the go ,active, stirring the pot, mentally stimulated. 
Pisces, on the other hand, is intuitive, dreamy, sensitive and driven by 
emotional content.
